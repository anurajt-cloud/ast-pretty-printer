# COMPSCI4021 Functional Programming H 

## Coursework template for the AST Pretty-Printer coursework

### Using Stack

* To build:

	stack build

* To test:

	stack test

### Using Cabal

If stack does not work, you have to use cabal.  Copy the `ASTEmitter.cabal` file from the folder `Cabal-file` into the folder `ASTEmitter`.

* To build:

	cabal build

* To test:

	cabal test

### Notes

* Read the specification on Moodle for more details.
* ASTInstances.hs contains 10 instances. I will use the same instances for testing, so there are no hidden tests, but I will change the names of the identifiers and values of the constants.
